# IMT-course
Personal repository of all C activities I did during embedded software course in IMT School.

This lib directory contains drivers for various components inside the AVR ATmega32, like timers, interrupts, ADC, and DIO. Also, in this directory you will find a Makfile that is used to build code into executables that run on the MCU. The makefile contains a rule to upload the executable to the MCU too.
